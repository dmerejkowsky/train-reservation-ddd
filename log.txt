* Used iterative development, but without refactoring and without TDD
* Writing the second test is (kind of) a nightmare!
* But keeping writing tests this way clearly won't work...

* Use TDD to implement FakeClient and HTTPClient
* Start rewriting TicketOffice to use a client
* Got bug because my ValueObject did not implement __eq__, __hash__ and __lt__. That
  was unpleasant
