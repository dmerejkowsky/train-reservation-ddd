* Used iterative development, but without refactoring and without TDD
* Writing the second test is (kind of) a nightmare!
* But keeping writing tests this way clearly won't work...
* So let's think about domain now
* Use TDD to implement FakeClient and HTTPClient
* Start rewriting TicketOffice to use a client
* Got bug because my ValueObject did not implement __eq__, __hash__ and __lt__. That
  was unpleasant
* After 4 hours of work, I finally have a 'Train' class - better late than never I guess :P

* After 5 hours - I finally got the red test I wanted:

```
AssertionError: Not enough room in coach A :
 [
   Seat(id=0A, booking_reference=old),
   Seat(id=1A, booking_reference=old),
   Seat(id=2A, booking_reference=old),
   Seat(id=3A, booking_reference=old),
   Seat(id=4A, booking_reference=old),
   Seat(id=5A, booking_reference=old),
   Seat(id=6A, booking_reference=old),
   Seat(id=7A, booking_reference=new),
   Seat(id=8A, booking_reference=new),
   Seat(id=9A, booking_reference=new)
]
 Reservation was:
   Reservation(reference=new, train=express_2000, seats=['7A', '8A', '9A', '0B'])
assert 1.0 <= 0.7
```
