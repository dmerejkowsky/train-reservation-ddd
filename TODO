# TODO

* Python3 everywhere
* Flask everywhere
* pytest for the guiding test
* httpx for the http clients
* requirements.txt

* ./booking_reference_service/ -> booking/
* ./train_data_service/ -> train_data/
* *.py -> ticket_office

* booking: better API - maybe 'POST reference/new' , 'GET reference/last' ?

* Dockerize the two services so you don't need Python for the kata
