# TODO

* Python3 everywhere
* Flask everywhere
* pytest for the guiding test
* httpx for the http clients
* requirements.txt


* booking: better API - maybe 'POST reference/new' , 'GET reference/last' ?

* train_data: return a 409 status code with a valid json {"error": ...} instead of
  200 OK and error message as invalid json (let's be nicer to the implementors)

* Dockerize the two services so you don't need Python for the kata

* Actually the SeatNumber should be a string of two digits "01".."99". For the moment they go from "0" to "9"
